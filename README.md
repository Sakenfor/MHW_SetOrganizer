Create sets that can contain mesh objects or ccl-capsules, or cct-header, and export them with one click, 
in short allowing multiple root,cct headers,capsules in same or multiple scenes.

Can also create sets of sets, and export multiple sets with one button, to a specific path, or each set's own custom path,
or simply to nativePC if no custom path is set.
